## Rational Numbers
Your task is to implement a class `Rational` representing rational numbers.
A rational number is a number expressed as a ratio `n/d` , where `n` (numerator)
and `d` (denominator) are integer numbers, except that `d` cannot be zero.
Examples of rational numbers are `1/2`, `2/3`, `117/1098`, and `2/1` (which we
can alternatively written simply as `2`).
Rational numbers are represented exactly, without rounding or
approximation, which gives them the advantage compared to floating-point numbers. 

Your task it to model the behavior of rational numbers, including allowing them
to be added, subtracted, multiplied, divided and compared.
All arithmetic and comparison operations must be available for rationals:
`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `&lt;`, `&gt;=` etc.

The `Rational` class should contain a numerator and denominator which might be
unlimited numbers, so use `java.util.BigInteger` class for storing them.

The rational numbers must be compared due to their "normalized" forms:
for example, `1/2` should be equal to `2/4`, or `117/1098` to `13/122`.
The string representation of a rational must be also given in the normalized form.

You need to support two ways to create rationals. The first one is to convert
a string representation to a rational directly, like in `"1/2".toRational()`.
Converting an integer number should also be possible, and `1` should be used
as denominator by default: `"23".toRational()` is the same as `"23/1".toRational()`.

The alternative way to create a rational is to use `divBy` infix function
like in `1 divBy 2`. The receiver and the argument might be of types `Int`,
`Long`, or `BigInteger.` 


#### Examples

All the following expressions must be evaluated to `true`:

```
(-2 divBy 4).toString() == "-1/2"
(2 divBy 1).toString() == "2"
"117/1098".toRational().toString() == "13/122"

"1/2".toRational() - "1/3".toRational() == "1/6".toRational()
"1/2".toRational() + "1/3".toRational() == "5/6".toRational()

-(1 divBy 2) == (-1 divBy 2)

(1 divBy 2) * (1 divBy 3) == "1/6".toRational()
(1 divBy 2) / (1 divBy 4) == "2".toRational()

(1 divBy 2) &lt; (2 divBy 3)
(1 divBy 2) in (1 divBy 3)..(2 divBy 3)

"912016490186296920119201192141970416029".toBigInteger() divBy
            "1824032980372593840238402384283940832058".toBigInteger() == 1 divBy 2
```
